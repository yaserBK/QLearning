# Multi-Agent Systems, Machine-Learning and Game-Theory

This repository contains code built around Reinforcement Learning agents designed to play Symmetric Normal-Form Games
(Such as the "prisoners-dilemma" or "chicken")

At the moment, the Agents use Q-learning, with exploration:exploitation balanced by _Îµ-greedy_

In the next iteration, I intend to have exploration determined by the _soft-max_ algorithm. 

The purpose of this is to constantly train agents and pit them against one another until they come upon a nash-equilibrium.
